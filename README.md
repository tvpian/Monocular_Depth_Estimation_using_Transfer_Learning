# Monocular-Depth-Estimation-using-Transfer-Learning
We estimate the dense depth map of each pixel using a single monocular RGB image using a deep learning-based transfer learning approach. Additionally, we implement a transfer learning-based method and an encoder-decoder structure to solve the monocular depth estimation task. The NYU dataset V2 is used for training the depth estimation models.
